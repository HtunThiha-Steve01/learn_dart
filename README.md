# 🎯 Let's Learn Dart!

[Dart](https://dart.dev/) is a modern, object-oriented programming language developed by Google. It is designed for building **fast**, **productive**, and **portable** applications — especially for web and mobile (via Flutter).

## ✨ Key Features

- **Compiled**: Dart compiles to native machine code and JavaScript.
- **Optimized for UI**: Especially powerful when used with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) for building beautiful apps.
- **Cross-platform**: Write once, run on Android, iOS, web, desktop, and server.
- **Productive**: Hot reload, modern tooling, and readable syntax.

## 🧭 Programming Paradigm

Dart supports multiple paradigms:
- **Object-Oriented** (with classes and inheritance)
- **Functional** (first-class functions, closures)
- **Imperative** and **asynchronous** (with `async`/`await`)

## 📦 Package Ecosystem

Dart has a rich package ecosystem available via [pub.dev](https://pub.dev):

- `http`: For making HTTP requests
- `path`: For file and path manipulation
- `collection`: Enhanced collection classes
- `provider` / `riverpod`: State management (popular with Flutter)
- `shelf`: For building backend web servers

Install packages using `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  http: ^1.2.0
```
